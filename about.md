This blog is the home for some *R* developers, statisticians and data scientists. 
We try to post neat stuff we learned, we want to promote on an irregular basis.

#### Zachary Jones

I am a graduate student at Pennsylvania State University where I work on methods for interpreting
statistical learning methods, dependent data, latent variable models for networks, and applications of these
methods in the social sciences. More information is on my [website](http://zmjones.com).

#### Mason Gallo

I am a graduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology specializing in machine learning. In addition 
to my research and open-source work, I am also passionate about training and education. I teach machine 
learning courses at General Assembly, and I'm also on the adjunct faculty at Columbia University. Go to 
my [personal page](http://masongallo.github.io/) to learn more about me.
