## The Package

[**mlr**](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr) is our *R* package to make *machine learning in R* easy for you and for us.
Trying out and comparing different machine learning methods in *R* was always a tedious task as you had to check every documentation to see how each function is called.
And not even the output is directly comparable.
Worry no more!
**mlr** has you covered: **cross-validation**, **variable selection**, **tuning** and many more can be easily done with **mlr** and a standardized interface!

## The Blog

This blog is the platform for some *R* developers, statisticians and data scientists to post hopefully interesting bits of knowledge about *machine learning*.
In one way or another we all contributed to **mlr** and want to present you some **highlights**, **hints** and **insights** of **mlr**.
We try to post neat stuff we learned and we want to promote on an irregular basis.

#### Zachary Jones

I am a graduate student at Pennsylvania State University where I work on methods for interpreting
statistical learning methods, dependent data, latent variable models for networks, and applications of these
methods in the social sciences. More information is on my [website](http://zmjones.com).

#### Mason Gallo

I am a graduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology specializing in machine learning. In addition 
to my research and open-source work, I am also passionate about training and education. I teach machine 
learning courses at General Assembly, and I'm also on the adjunct faculty at Columbia University. Go to 
my [personal page](http://masongallo.github.io/) to learn more about me.
